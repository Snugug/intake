<h2>User Personas</h2>

<p>User personas are a tool to distill different types of people who may interact with a product into caricatures in order to work with the different types of people effectively.</p>
<p>In order to create user personas, interviews (ideally in person one-on-one or focus groups) should be conducted with different types of users in order to get a statistically relevant overview of each user type.</p>
<p>When creating user personas, do not fall into the trap of assigning stereotypes to personas, such as 'young adults only know how to write through text message shorthand' or that 'mobile users are rushed and distracted'. Personas should be generated based on statistical analysis of the interviews performed, creating groups. What should divide users into similar groups are significant areas where multiple users use the product in similar ways or have similar pain points, not small differences (or potentially even seemingly large differences like demographic). User personas are about how users <em>use</em> a product and what they expect from it.</p>
