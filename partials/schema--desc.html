<h2>Content Models</h2>
<footer>From <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-modeling">Content Modeling</a></footer>
<p>A content model is an overview of the different types of content available for the product. Each type of content is modeled to include its attributes (what make it up, its chunks). A good content model includes both visible and structural attributes. Before starting to model content, a <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-inventory">Content Inventory</a> and subsequent <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#content-audit">Content Audit</a> should be performed.</p>
<p><a href="http://globalmoxie.com/jhc/prez/mobile-myths.pdf">Presentations deprecate</a>, but content lives on, so it is important for the content to be modeled to be reusable across any presentation and not contain <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#device-detection">presentation-specific</a> attributes (such as iPhone Title or Desktop Image). A content model should be effective across any presentation.</p>
<p>When creating content models, it is also important to know how they fit in to the larger goals of a project. As such, each content model should include benefit statements for <a href="#/personas">user personas</a> (as needed) and a <a href="http://pointnorth.io/#size-and-value">value</a> to that user, which should be a determination of how close their benefit statement aligns with the <a href="#/vision">vision</a> of the project.</p>
